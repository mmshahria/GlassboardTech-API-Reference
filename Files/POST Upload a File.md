Upload a document file using the `multipart/form-data` file upload mechanism. 

> The media-type `multipart/form-data` follows the rules of all multipart MIME or Multipurpose Internet Mail
  Extensions.  In forms, there are a series of fields to be supplied by the users who fills out the form. Each field has a name. Within a given form, the names are unique. As with other multipart types, a boundary is selected that does not occur in any of the data. Each field of the form is sent, in the order defined by the sending application and form, as a part of the multipart stream.  Each part identifies the INPUT name within the original form. Each part should be labelled with an appropriate `content-type` if the media type is known.
