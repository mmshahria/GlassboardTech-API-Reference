Assets represent the investment vehicle for a deal. An asset can take one of many forms, such as, shares of common stock in a company, real estate, crypocurrency, or even fractional ownership in a private jet. The object specification is general enough to include a complete description of the asset, supporting documentation, and profiles of the key team members.
