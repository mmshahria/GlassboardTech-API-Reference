Closing is the final event to complete the investment, at which time all the legal documents are signed and the funds are transferred. A close can represent the close of the entire deal or just a subset of investments (i.e. a tranche).

> "closing" refers to the time when investors sign a limited partnership agreement and legally commit to provide capital to the fund.  There can be one closing, or a series of closings.  When there is a series of closings, the first closing is known as the "initial closing" or "first close" and the final closing is known as the "final closing."
